# among-us-plague-knight-mask
Among us Plague Knight (from Shovel Knight) mask texture mod. This mod applies a Plague Knight mask texture over the Halloween plague doctor hat.

Because this mod goes over a Halloween item, you will either have to: a) Have played during October previously or b) Change the date of your device to Halloween, changing it back after unlocking the Halloween hats.
